# Anchore SBOM Action

A GitHub Action for creating a software bill of materials (SBOM)
using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).

## Basic Usage

```yaml
- uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
```

By default, this action will execute a Syft scan in the workspace directory
and upload a workflow artifact SBOM in SPDX format. It will also detect
if being run during a `release` and attach the SBOM
as a release asset.

## Example Usage

### Scan a docker image

Use the `image` parameter

```yaml
- uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
  with:
    image: example/image_name
```

### Scan a specific directory

Use the `path` parameter, relative to the repository root

```yaml
- uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
  with:
    path: ./build/
```

### Attach SBOMs to a release explicitly

The action will detect being run in a `release` and
automatically upload all SBOMs as release assets. However,
it may be desirable to upload SBOMs generated with other tools or using Syft
outside of this action. To do this, specify a regular expression using
the `sbom-artifact-match` pararmeter, for example:

```yaml
- uses: anchore/sbom-action/attach@v1
  sbom-artifact-match: "*.sbom"
```

### Naming the SBOM output

By default, this action will upload an artifact named
`sbom-<job-name>[-<step-id|step-number>].<format>`, for
example:

```yaml
build:
  steps:
    - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
    - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
    - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
      id: myid
```

Will create 3 artifacts:

```text
sbom-build.spdx
sbom-build-2.spdx
sbom-build-myid.spdx
```

You may need to name these artifacts differently, simply
use the `artifact_name` parameter:

```yaml
- uses: anchore/sbom-action@v1
  with:
    artifact_name: sbom.spdx
```

### Diagnostics

This action makes extensive use of GitHub Action debug logging,
which can be enabled as [described here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md)
by setting a secret in your repository of `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true`.
